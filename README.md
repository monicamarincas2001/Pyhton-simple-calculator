# Pyhton-simple-calculator
This is my first begginer project I ever made, in 2019, but I didn't upload it then because I didn't have a GitHub account. :)
The program runs from calculations.py
I didn't want to modify anything I did back in 2019 (even though now I have enough knowledge to make the project better) because I wanted to 
keep it as a reminder for where I started and I wanted to make this visible to everyone. :)
